## What is hacking?
+ is it modifying?
+ professionals vs hack
+ jeans metaphor - hacking the jeans to cut them off, vs taking them to the tailor
+ media aportrays the hackers as people who are breaking the law, where as others (maybe older and less techfamiliar) perceive hacking as a negative
+ 'unauthorized or illicit' vs 'creative or encouraged'
+ three definitions
  - modifying, creative, generative
  - amateur activity, as opposed to professional
  - unauthorized, illicit, illegal
+ hackers as tinkerers
+ what is the motivation behind hacking?
+ there's a spectrum â€“ a transformative, creative, knowledge-seeking experience (see: Mackenzie Wark), or an illicit, destructive experience, anti-intellectual
+ hacking as rule-breaking
+ hacking vs disruptive technologies
+ the multitude as the new proletariat - the creative class
+ wark believes the hacker attitude is tat there's a new relation to your labor - hackerdom is a reclaiming of classical alienation
+ we might be arguing that this rhetoric, and the relationship itself can becoopted by the corporate environment, or used as a tool to reduce wages and benefits, etc

## fenster reading
+ do released documents have any effect? what are the positives, what are the negatives?
+ blanton's argument was that experts who spoke after the retired, they said 50% of classified documents were unuseful, more recent estimates are like 70, 80% of materials get classified with no reason
+ there might be some kind of natural reasoning for government to keep secrets
+ in the hands of the citizen, the layman, cryptography is a tool, but in the hands of the government it's a conspiratorial means
+ there is a tension between applying the same concepts between private affairs and bureaucratic corporate affiars
+ security - a government or company controlling access, privacy - a single person's ability to control access
+ if you believe in radically open and transparent society, this also calls for a radical dissolution of privacy
+ does transparency result in a more virtuous government?
+ a government insists on increased secrecy for them, but less for you
+ the circle by dave eggers - transparent government and transparent society
+ fenster's quantity over quality -> assange chose quality
+ it also restricts things to a class of people who are able to read it - likely using computational tools
+ distant reading vs close reading - the ability to find interesting patterns using code makes a good citizen
+ this discourse mirrors the libertarian right to bear arms
+ people who are arming themselves with code tools rather than guns
+ the tension between centralized and decentralized systems
  - you have your email clients - centralized system like gmail
  - centralized systems are susceptible to control
  - one way to combat on centralization is to decentralize control - start your own server
  - you could also launch amazon servers, where you have more control, but still provided by a corporate, centralized entity
+ fenster argues that quantity > quality, information being out there implies it will never again be confidential (p777)
