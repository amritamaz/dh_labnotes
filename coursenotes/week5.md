# Digital Humanities Week 5

## Midterm Project
- 10-15 _seminal_ texts
- bibliography can be for any week in the semester

## Open vs Free
- "open access" is more narrow, applies more for academic peer reviewed and relates to creative commons a bit
- "free software" is a bit more strictly free
- the two concepts came out at the same time, and they are related, but they might fall into different domains (scholarly, software-related, political)

## Mumford - Democratic Technics
+ there is a dichotomy between democratic technics (something that enables democracy) and authoritarian technics (the opposite of democratic)
+ Mumford's democracy is in favor of humans - like humanism
+ humanism - self-driven, self-actualized, 'be all you can be'
- humanism is a very 'american' notion, very self-help book fodder
- Mumford's democracy is very person-to-person, very small-scale, and authoritarianism is just an abstraction above it
- democratic systems are not as efficient, but it is self-normalizing
- what are 'technics' - a systematic view of things
- this has tinges of Marxism, but not as stringent of a 'modes of production' argument
- systems encompass some technological stuff, some institutions, some codifications
	- ex: in th university, we are made of desks, clocks, podiums, but also faculty members, students, staff, and we have rules of conduct and an honor code, etc.
- technics - looking at organization past the hman - the universiyt is not just its people but its things
- technics - how systems shape reality and the land in a Heideggerian context
- you could argue that writing is an authoritarian technic, or you could argue that writing brought about the englihtenment and emancipated humanity from the rule of the view
- writing enables bureaucracy, writing enables legal structures that employ and restrict you
- but examining libraries, its those kinds of systems and technics that allow us to feel more open and free
- you get served the service because you are the product
- your experience viewing babies and your friends is hsaped by your background and you as the product
- and because these systems are centralized and hosted by a single entity, the government can assert control over these systems and this ecomes problematic
- the question is why did we accept this bargain? this is a bad deal - for this little bit of extra efficiency and human contact, we have given up a lt f fundamental humanity and autonomy
- mumford and moglun would sa fundamentaly this threatens democracy
- Mumford has been accused of **technodeterminism** - society organizes itself to use and interact with technology 
- so, just because facebook is centralized, it _has_ to become a government agent? why can't we just organize against it? this is the antideterminist argument
- you can take the "guns dont kill people, people kill people" argument and use it against 
- see also: "do artifacts have politics?" langdon winner
	- technology does shape society in so far as actions taken by people using technology can have long lasting sociopolitical influence
	- mumford may be trying to see 
- in many of the movements we study, from pirate library to cryptopunk movements, they dont use the word 'technics' or 'democratic' or 'authoritarian', but there is a strong notion of centralisation and decentralisation
- centralized systems are not deterministically bad, but they're easily deterred by centralised authority
- facebook is easier than me stealing all your id cards - that's difficult! it's decentralised
- the argument is for technology that is resistant to central control
- that's not a question of determinism, but a practical question - how easy is it for any central authority to compromise your data or something
- how easy is it for someone to enslave us? that's why we decentralise these things and distributing these books
- we should have weak-ly connected clouds of our own, ones we extend and control of our own volition
- people may say "these things are a pain in the butt but someone like Eben Moglen would say **that is your duty as a citizen** to do these kinds of things
- what does it do for democracy when an institution forces an identity upon you
- writing is decentralised, as an acivity, but writing as a product, stored in libraries or archives, is very centralised

## Benkler and Peer Production
+ it has been argued that liberal/progressive thought, particularly in the western world, has reached a criss
+ with the demise of socialism as a viable political alternative, with the demise of the marxist vocabulary of production, something something centralized state
- some vision of the common good, the 'commons', and the vision of humanity in service of the common good, that ision was given to us by marxism, and embraced by liberals
- then you have the fall of the soviet union and the mroal bankruptcy, and experiments in marxist living that lead to authoritarian regimes
- people like Unger say we just need another ideology, that has progressive roots (not democratic progressive, but progressive in the liberal tradition that goes back to Mill and Lacke) Unger argues that an alternative is needed
- People like Benkler et al have been searching for an alternative vocabulary
- we live in a time where this new alt vocab has been found, in a deep intellectual tradition that, instead of reaching back to the roots of socialism, reaches to the traditino of anarchism
- Sometimes it reaches anarchy explicitly, as we will read, or kind of implicit and secretly, the way Benkler does
- There is a resurgence of anarchist thought as a viable political alternative to this grand vision and way forward for liberal democratists
- in his discussion fo production, and peer production, you expect some talk of labor in the marxist sense
- "First, it is better at identifying and assigning human capital to information and cultural production processes. In this regard, peer production has an advantage in what I call “information opportunity cost.” That is, it loses less information about who the best person for a given job might be than either of the other two organizational modes." - what are these two modes?
	- the first is free market
	- a better way to do things is to decentralize
	- free market as a computer, as a self-regulating system
	- do you want a computer that is distributed, or a central CPU type of computer?
	- look at a free market as a way of processing information
	- it doesn't look at free market in terms of captial or economics or ethics, it doesn't talk about the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' or anything like that
	- the way Benkler talks about markets is in terms of information
	- the second is corporate - what Benkler calls the firm
	- group structure is heirarchical and the deicison making is centralised
	- this is also a way to solve problems - think of the way information flows through an org chart at a company
	- Benkler says, that some problems are actually better solved by using a corporate structure
	- It's not a moral argument, it's two systematic information procesing - it's a systems view
	- There are two systematic ways of viewing it, in a matehmatical context, taken from like a business management point of view
- How is free market different from firm? In the free market, the individual has choic, which is also true in the peer production market
- In he firm based model, choices are made by the boss or Mr. Manager
- In the free marekt, the signal is money, you spend money to signal you want something
- peer production is not based on financial gain, it's based on information
- the way peer production differs from free market ideology is the commons, and there is a psychological component that you paticipate, not because you get paid, but because you might enjoy it, or because you have altrusistic motives
- comment from the class: it seems like all of this is like a struggle because if you work really hard and are really mad and to spite you someone lese does exactly what you did but better, it's hard to be mad if it's for the common good
- comment from the class: there's also a lot of homogeney in the kinds of people working at peer production, and creating a potentially exclusive environment
- tough question: why do peer production models fail? well, corporations fail, states fail, 
- is peer production limited to everyone on the planet?
- benkler says 'integration' is important - that's what makes peer production important
- its' not necessarily a person required for integration
- when you write on wikipedia, the friction f integration is very low - or for example, when we learn github, when we try to integrate your code into other peoples' code, the tool tries to merge things together
- tehre are systems that canb e set up to facilitate the ease of integration
