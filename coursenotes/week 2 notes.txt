# Hughes
+ explanation of copyright's origins and why we would want to use it
+ Lockean justification
   + doesn't always translate when goods are converted to money
   + the waste/spoil of goods that don't go to the common argument
     doesn't always work
   + lumpy goods
+ Hegelian justification
   + self-actualization
   + you are the spirit - this vague thing
   + the way to go from this vague thing into a real thing is to express yourself
   + go from this nebulous cloud of undefined things is to self-actualize
      + buy clothes
      + make things
      + all of your things and possessions are what make you 
      + all of your things keep you from being nothing
   + you can be part of a body (like the student body) and the body itself
has this kind of logic by which it can self-actualize
   + there's this nebulous hierarchy of bodies trying to actualize
   + at the top of these successive circles is the spirit of world history - and that history is also self-actualizing into something
   + we should be respectful of property, of words, because that messes with someone's freedom to self-actualize
+ copyright is understood as protecting the author but it actually works to protect the commercial interests of the publisher
+ locke imagines a natural order before law - so the property ideas come pre-law
+ what is system theory?!?!!!!
