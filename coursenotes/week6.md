# Week 6
3/4/14 - ()we are now a week behind)

## Recap: Where are we?
+ We talked about copyright, the basis of copyright, in property law, and the philosophy of property in the traditional liberal sense
+ We talked about the 'Commons', the tragedy of the commons, the idea of the commons
+ We talked, generally, in the second week, about public and common knowledge
+ What does it mean to know something publicly? What is common to us all?
+ Week 4 was open access - doesn't mean things are not copyrighted or proprietary, or that you can see the source code or alter it, all it means is there are **no barriers to _access_**
+ the movement to redress that global inaccess to knowledge is open access
+ Then we talked generally about peer production and remix culture
+ Peer production - wikipedia, openstreetmap, even regular scholarship, i.e. physicicsts contributing to the body of knowledge about physics
+ What are the characteristics of peer production?
	- Modular - needs to be easily split into small tasks
		- a novel is a bad peer production task, but an article in an encyclopedia works better
	- Cost of Integration must be low
- Benkler - was looking at various models of organizing people to produce something - one of those model was the corporate model (hierarchical)
	- think of this structure as a way of transmitting information, through this hierarchy
	- you can almost come up with a mathematical model to demonstrate how this model is efficient
	- the other model is the free market model of transmitting information?
		- he's looking it not as an economic model, but an information processing model
	- in the free market, we get signals about information, and microdecisions make information calibrate itself
	- this is the traditional economic theory
	- the free market economy is kind of inefficient, with its random signals, with everything converging to some goal or some need
	- if you ahve a startup, you say the market is telling me what we need
	- when the market is inefficient, the corporation comes in, and they say we are going to do this in a much more efficient way
	- the corporation is centralized, and hierarchical - the model of trnasmiting information is the same between communism and mcdonalds, for transmitting information
	- you have either a centralized system, or the free market about decentralized systems
	- THIS IS SO WEIRDLY CLOSE TO PARALLEL AND CENTRALIZED PROGRAMMING
	- benkler looks at corporate structure, and sees inefficiency, and looks at free market culture, and sees inefficiency
	- the third alternative that Benkler sees is peer production
	- in the free market, it's dominated by dollars, but in peer production its dominated by a human interest or social capital

###Thoughts:
- for a long time computer designs were focused on making as fast and powerful of a processor as possible
- but now we use parallel processing systems and think about how to split up problems into parallelizable issues
- the question is not whether things suit the parallel model, but how we can get them to fit best
- will this happen with peer production?

## Week 6 Readings
- moglen and stallman seem to have their intellectual roots not in libertarianism, socialism, classical liberalism, but motivated by some vision of anarchism. they will occasionally they will explicitly say "this is triumphant"
- tenen: 'we are living in an age where we saw the moral and practiccal bankruptcy of socialism and communism, so we're seeing the birth of practical anarachism'
- Moglen's econodwarf
- Why does Moglen turn code into literature? so he can make the argument that software is another art, and you can say that code can be a labor of love in the same way art and music are
- Moglen's thesis - first Monday - code is a bitstream. it is weird that some numbers are just numbers, like 7, or 70239, and that's not copyrightable. But other numbers like music, are copyrightable, and others are trade secrets.
- A lot of copyright law comes down to the material instantiation
- Are random strings of letters copyrightable? Are random strings of numbers? What changes a numer from being random and not?
- Property law is based on physical things, but intellectual property law is based on *ideas*, and this is what Moglen and others struggle with - a code is not a physical object, it has all these properties that are not in the physical world
- remember the plum tree - bits are not like that. they're reusable, there are many of them, etc
- people that contribute to open source also usually have other jobs
- benkler - a good peer production project is one where people can contribute in small manageable chunks of time
- von Hippel - here is a mode of production that doesn't tear down capitalism
- is the political ambition of anarchism in the free software model related to the equating of code and art
- defining yourself through work is what very typically pop-psych driven american-type mindsets
- Moglen sees this not as a choice, but as a deterministic path
- with peer production, if you enable a system where people sign up for the things they want, then eventually things gets done - that's his vision

## Moving on to Stallman
+ when you buy a physical pen, you can dissemble and reengineer it into whatever tool you want, and you're not going to get sued or anything
+ what bothers people like Stallman is that you can't apply that logic to proprietary software - you bought it, you should be able to mess around with it
+ we are very entangled with our software - for Stallman it is crazy that we are not allowed to hack at it
+ copyleft - alternative licensing schemes - skirting the problems of copyright and Moglen
+ Free software - classic property argument - if it's my property, I can do what I want with it, I can scratch my record but I can't muck with my software
+ Moglen says software is not property, but Stallman says no it **is** property
+ barriers to entry are high for software, fairly small, fairly elite, 
+ locked-in syndrome - the barriers to leaving a proprietary software does exist, and coercecion is what we want to work against
+ regulation does not keep up well enough with the affordances of technology
+ centralised vs distributed

## Creative Commons
- as a homework, read the text of the GPL, the CC license
- on the table we have many terms
	- free software and free access
	- open access
	- creative commons
- where do you stand? traditional property copyright regime, then we have all of these alternatives
- next time you write a paper or blog post, what do you put under there, on the byline? a cc,
