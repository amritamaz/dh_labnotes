+ find a good body of work and annotate the bibliography
+ pick a topic from one of the classes

Last week - we  saw the beginnings of copyright and legality
+ copyright and censorship 
+ there is a long history of necessity in censorship and copyright going back to Locke
+ even though it seems that digital age is new and scary, when we read the debates around free and public libraries, we see the same arguments expressed
+ it's important to link open access and free culture to these earlier discussions
+ open access and free culture did not arise from a digital vacuum


## Locke
+ What is the Lockean notion of property?
+ It underpins everything in Western liberal capitalism
+ commons intertwined with labor
+ Locke came out of a context where the commons didn't exist and the monarchical property rights came from a justification of a  king from god
+ how does this fit in with open source culture
+ should the goal be to maintain or augment the common, rather than to augment it?
 - examine if the commons is limitless or limited
+ locke is commonly misquoted in second treatise on government - he starts by saying there is this state of nature where people are - that's the first chapter
+ the sate of nature is pre-civil society and before we enter a civil contract with each other, it has rights and logic blah blah - the second chapter is on the state of war
+ in the state of nature, we start fighting over stuff, and there's no power to adjudicate between our conflicts, that's the state of war
+ they exist all the time - that's the state of nature/war
+ whenever you have agents without a higher power is that governing, that is state of nature
+ lock's commons is _limited_ and _perishable_
+ what do you do in the lockean system? convert your extra plums into money
+ money is there because it's _not_ perishable
+ it's ok to collect all the plums from the commons, because you have to transform them into money, and then you can exchange that 
+ for Locke this isn't bad, and money is there to prevent waste
+ we want all the trees to be picked clean, we don't want anything to remain in the commons, because commons is inefficient
+ if we convert all the commons into goods, and then we maximize the common good
+ as a result of the commons and property, we decide not to fight over things
+ Locke has no notion of "the commons" once we have social contract or government

## Things that Don't fit in with the Lockean theory
+ Air, water, etc
+ valuation of goods
+ an idea that i potentially could get monetary value from
+ intangibles
+ potential things
+ abstract things that we share in common that can be destroyed in some real way
+ to what extent do abstract, symbolic things fit into a commons?

## Other Locke Thoughts
+ how proximate are ideas to a person? how far away?
+ at the bottom of all rhetoric about protecting companies or structures for idea propagation is whether it is in the common good - is it better for a business to be built or for government to do it?
+ it's not that copyright people are all about greed and free culture people are all about anarchy, but everyone wants a common good to ensure a lot of people

+ Deriving secondary value from free content - different from the previous methods of 

+ assessing need is incredibly difficult
+ GPL - phaedrus - you are only allowed to recreate this in the way I say
+ the Berry piece equates information and content
