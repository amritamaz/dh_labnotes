##Hacker Manifesto
+ Mckenzie Wark - now at new school
+ kind of an influential text

### Manifestation
+ creation vs possession
+ 30s summary of Marx: it's all about production and labor and who owns the mode of production
+ this is similar, there are those who create stuff and those who own it
+ hacking is not a digital-only production, but it's about "programming language, poetic language, math or music", all these people are hackers of sorts - the possibility of entering new things into the world
+ creating something out of nothing
+ translation: "we are witnessing the birth of a new class, related to a means of production a la marx. there is a new mode of production happening."


### Abstraction
+ def: obscuring away from worldly or essential goods; hiding away
+ information must be material - conveyed somehow through some medium
+ virtual communities are not actually transient - everything is physical
+ "information is always connected to physical matter" - medium is the message
+ in the transmission information will become free from the material culture

### Production
+ "To produce is to repeat; to hack, to differentiate."
+ In Marx, labor is repetitive
+ humanism - to be human is to have freedom of will, but here the freedom is to emancipate things and use them in whatever way you see fit
+ "things" - material constructs?
+ knowledge transmission - how do people understand informal networks of knowledge
+ there are strong and weak formal ways of regulating information flow - like school
+ "expansion of freedom from necessity"

### Class
+ ideological alterantive to marxism that builds off a new mode of production - which is hacker culture
+ an alternative to '"centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state." from marxism
+ vectoral - why? what does it mean? vectoralists - ISPs? 
+ nobody wants to make things, just the pipelines are the important part
+ the producer has been marginalized - the gateways and pipelines are where the money is
+ we moved from phsyical to more virtual goods, and with a rising glut, the power changes from who produces it to who controls its production or its distribution
+ the power has shifted to a different kind of class
+ victorian internet - vectoralists existed in the past as well
+ agrarian vs pastoralist - any reason?

### Property
+ owning something restricts information - once information becomes a form of property
+ form of accumulation - patent portfolios
+ gift economy - levi strauss
+ creative activity not constrained that emanates from within you - benkler says you usualy are not going to edit wikipedia for 8 hours - special prodjects are amenable to it
+ things that look like gift economy but still accrue capital that you can cash out on

### Vector
+ means by which something travels
+ way by which information moves
+ footnote - the internet archive tries to preserve the internet bc without google the internet is lost
+ when you cite something or want to save something from the internet, make a snapshot with the internet archive

### Education
+ thiel fellowship
+ suit as uniform
+ this ethos exists, even if it sounds extreme: anti-education
+ knowledge and the education system are disjoint at some fundamental level - other people cannot access it

### Hacking
+ liberate informatino from porpety
+ think of kindle - even though the bits are abstract and infinitely reproducible, you can't do it - tries to fake it as a real book and one copy of it, the hacker can liberate it

[glossed over information]

### Representation
+ representation of information really influences how it works
+ an academic exercise - taking shots at the politics of representation and marxist critique - there is a school of academics that through scholarship due marxist critique - fixing the world through critique
+ representation is false and it's all bs - critique is not a solution
+ this section is a bit of academic infighting - 
+ this is a dig at identity politics, by framing it as representation politics, colorblind gender neutral etc etc
+ he is trying to imagine that hacker culture frees you from this bar of representation, that hacker culture takes you past it
+ the refusal of the hacker class as a class
+ marx imagined communism would bring you to a place where identity politics were gone - wark ends his manifesto with a similar thing
