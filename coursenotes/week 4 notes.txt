## Creating a Roadmap of terms
+ Open Access - access to text, academic publications
	- there are some publishers and aggregators that close information right this

+ open software usually refers to a particular way of writing and distributing that code
+ Free software - there is an overlap with open software but there is also a split - free software tends to be slightly more radical in its political and social goals
+ alternative copyright, copyleft, licensing - this applies to everything because it's a way to license things under any of these schemes
+ creative commons coverts text, software, images
+ peer production - maybe even bigger than licensing
	- things like open access are inherently single-author

+ why would you want to contribute to a project for free?

- what is the difference between NYT, Wikipedia, and scholarship?
	- investigative journalism is expensive and should be compensated
	- scholarship has a different production and economic model

	- not every model fits into open access or peer production
	- in scholarship, you get paid by the university, but you write on your own
	- is scholarly publication more like wikipedia or NYT?

- ProQuest - collects dissertations
	- cataloguing was not centralized early 20th century
